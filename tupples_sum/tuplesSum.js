/**
 * Returns a set of couples summing to a given number.
 * Using hash for direct storage and access, this results in 0(n) time-complexity. The space complexity is O(n), since
 * additional memory is required for longer input. The worst space case is when there is no couple match.
 *
 * Note: In a naive for-loop, an existing couple is added in pathing order of every first number. It would result
 * in O(nÂ²) time-complexity and O(n) space-complexity, because it would have to store values to avoid repetitions.
 * In the hash implementation, a couple is added only after the second number appears in the pathing order.
 * Thus the resulting array is ordered differently.
 *
 * @param arr array of integers to search in.
 * @param sum wanted sum.
 * @return all couples of elements summing to a given number.
